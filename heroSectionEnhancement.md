# Hero Section Enhancements

## Current Hero Assessment

The current hero section effectively introduces Will Diamond with a terminal aesthetic, displaying name, title, and a brief tagline with a typing animation effect. While visually appealing, it could be enhanced with real-time data and more dynamic elements to showcase technical prowess and active development habits.

## GitHub Activity Integration

### Real-Time Stats Panel

Add a compact terminal-style "dashboard" displaying live GitHub stats:

```
$ github stats --user=spartypkp --refresh=daily

> Status: Active Developer
> Total Contributions: 782 (Last 12 months)
> Current Streak: 7 days
> Favorite Language: Python (73%)
> Last Commit: "Fix RAG implementation edge case" (2 hours ago)
> Top Repo: open-source-legislation (⭐ 47)
```

### Contribution Heat Map

- Miniature version of the GitHub contribution graph
- Terminal-styled with ASCII-art inspired representation
- Color intensity representing commit frequency
- Interactive on hover to show specific day details

### Commit Activity Visualization

- Small animated terminal showing "live" commits
- Mimics commits flowing through a pipeline
- Text appears character-by-character like real-time logging
- Shows recent real commit messages pulled from GitHub API

## Additional Hero Enhancements

### Interactive Command Line

- Add a pseudo-interactive command line beneath the hero section
- Visitors can type predefined commands to navigate the site
- Commands like `ls projects`, `cd about`, `cat skills.txt`
- Provides alternative navigation that matches the terminal theme

### Tech Stack Badges

- Compact display of key technologies in your stack
- Terminal-styled badges with skill levels or years of experience
- Animated "loading bars" showing proficiency levels
- Example: `[Python: ████████░░ 80%] [LLM Engineering: ███████░░░ 70%]`

### Live Status Indicator

- "System status" showing your current availability
- Updates based on time of day or custom settings
- States like "Available for projects", "Open to work", "Currently coding"
- Blinking cursor or animated dots for active status

### Credentials Quick View

- Compact display of key credentials in terminal format
- Education, certifications, major positions
- Styled as system information display

### AI Assistant Preview

- Small preview window of a conversation with an AI assistant
- Shows your skill at prompt engineering
- Animated typing effect for both prompts and responses
- Option to expand into full AI assistant demo

## Technical Implementation

### Data Sources

- GitHub API for live repository and contribution data
- Optional integration with Wakatime for coding statistics
- LocalStorage to cache API results and reduce calls

### Performance Considerations

- Lazy load GitHub data after initial page render
- Implement graceful fallbacks if API limits are reached
- Use skeleton loaders during data fetch

### Visual Integration

- Maintain the existing terminal aesthetic
- Use monospace fonts and terminal color schemes
- Implement subtle animations that mimic terminal behavior
- Ensure mobile responsiveness with adaptive layouts

## Next Steps

1. Research GitHub API endpoints needed for desired metrics
2. Create a fetching and caching layer for GitHub data
3. Design the visual layout of the enhanced hero section
4. Implement skeleton states for data loading
5. Test performance impact and optimize as needed
6. Add progressive enhancement for non-critical features

## Expected Benefits

- Demonstrates technical implementation abilities directly in the UI
- Shows active development habits with real data
- Creates a more engaging first impression
- Establishes credibility through visible activity
- Makes the portfolio stand out with unique, developer-focused features
