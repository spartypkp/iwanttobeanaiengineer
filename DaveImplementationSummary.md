# Dave AI Implementation Summary

## Overview

We've successfully designed and partially implemented "Dave," an AI assistant for Will's portfolio website. Dave uses a terminal-inspired interface to answer questions about Will's skills, projects, and experience using the Anthropic Claude model via Vercel's AI SDK.

## Components Created

### 1. Core UI Component
- `TerminalChat.tsx`: A reusable React component that provides a terminal-styled chat interface with:
  - Terminal window styling (header bar, control buttons)
  - Message history display with user/assistant distinction
  - Loading indicators and typing animations
  - Auto-scrolling behavior
  - Command handling (including `clear` command)

### 2. API Integration
- `src/app/api/dave/route.ts`: A Next.js API route that:
  - Integrates with the Anthropic Claude model
  - Provides specialized tools for accessing project and skill information
  - Handles special commands
  - Implements error handling and response streaming

### 3. Data Layer
- `src/data/skills.json`: Structured data about Will's skills
- `src/data/projects.json`: Structured data about Will's projects
- `src/lib/data.ts`: Utility functions for accessing and searching skills and projects data

### 4. Dave Page
- `src/app/dave/page.tsx`: Updated Dave page with:
  - Modern layout with suggested questions sidebar
  - Integration of the terminal chat component
  - Command reference section

### 5. Styling
- Added terminal-specific styles to the global CSS

## Technical Details

### Key Features
1. **Terminal Aesthetic**: We've created a realistic terminal-style interface with:
   - Window controls (close, minimize buttons)
   - Command prompt styling
   - Blinking cursor and typing indicators
   - Monospace font and terminal colors

2. **Real-time AI Integration**: Using Vercel AI SDK for:
   - Streaming responses (text appears gradually)
   - Seamless integration with Claude API
   - Tool-based retrieval of portfolio content

3. **RAG Implementation**: Dave can retrieve specific information about:
   - Will's skills and proficiency levels
   - Project details and features
   - Search across skills and projects for relevant information

4. **Command System**: Support for special terminal commands like:
   - `help`: Display available commands
   - `clear`: Reset the conversation
   - Future commands for projects, skills, etc.

## Next Steps

1. **Dependencies Installation**: Install required packages:
   ```bash
   npm install ai @ai-sdk/react @ai-sdk/anthropic zod clsx tailwind-merge
   ```

2. **Environment Setup**: Create a `.env.local` file with the Anthropic API key:
   ```
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

3. **Testing and Refinement**:
   - Test the chat interface with various queries
   - Refine prompts based on response quality
   - Add more structured data as needed

4. **Advanced Features** (Post-MVP):
   - Persistent conversation history
   - Analytics to track common questions
   - Multi-modal support (images, links)
   - More specialized portfolio tools

## Implementation Notes

- The implementation uses the latest Vercel AI SDK which supports streaming and tool usage
- The terminal UI is built entirely with React and Tailwind CSS
- Type safety is maintained throughout the codebase with TypeScript interfaces
- The data layer is designed to be extensible as Will's portfolio grows

## Challenges and Solutions

- **API Integration**: We've addressed potential API issues by:
  - Adding thorough error handling
  - Providing fallbacks for missing data
  - Using type-safe interfaces for all data structures

- **UX Design**: We've ensured a smooth user experience by:
  - Adding loading states and typing indicators
  - Providing suggested questions for easy starting points
  - Making the interface intuitive despite the technical terminal aesthetic

This implementation provides a solid foundation for Dave as an AI representative of Will's skills and experience, with clear next steps for completion and enhancement.
