# Content Copilot MVP - User Experience Design

## Overview

Content Copilot is an AI assistant embedded within Sanity Studio that helps create and edit document content through natural conversation. The MVP focuses on making content creation feel like talking to a helpful colleague rather than filling out forms.

## Core Experience Goals

1. **Reduce Friction**: Eliminate the "blank page problem" where users struggle to begin writing
2. **Natural Extraction**: Pull structured content from casual conversations
3. **Iterative Refinement**: Help users improve content quality over time
4. **Context Awareness**: Maintain knowledge of document structure and current state

## MVP Feature Set

### 1. Conversation Patterns

- **Natural Dialog**: Maintain conversational context across messages without repetitive questioning
- **Storytelling Extraction**: Enable users to explain in their own words, then extract relevant details
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Begin with essential fields, then suggest additional details
- **Guided Completion**: Help users complete required fields without overwhelming them

### 2. Document Awareness

- **Schema Understanding**: Know field types, requirements, and validation rules
- **Content Status**: Track which fields are complete/incomplete
- **Field Relationships**: Understand connections between related fields (e.g., problem â†’ solution)
- **Visual Indicators**: Show progress toward document completion

### 3. Content Enhancement

- **Drafting Assistance**: 
  - Generate first drafts based on simple prompts or outlines
  - Structure long-form content with appropriate formatting
  
- **Refinement Suggestions**:
  - Improve clarity and conciseness
  - Ensure consistency of tone and terminology
  - Adapt content based on target audience
  
- **Formatting Optimization**:
  - Suggest appropriate headings, lists, and paragraphs
  - Recommend content structure for readability

### 4. Intelligent Field Population

- **Multi-field Extraction**: Populate multiple related fields from a single user message
- **Smart Defaults**: Suggest logical values for fields based on context
- **Automatic Tagging**: Identify relevant categories and keywords
- **Pattern Recognition**: Learn from existing content to suggest consistent formatting

### 5. Content Validation & Quality Assurance

- **Completeness Checks**: Identify missing required information
- **Consistency Validation**: Flag contradictory information
- **Quality Suggestions**: Recommend improvements for weak or thin content
- **Length Optimization**: Ensure content meets expected length requirements

## Interaction Model

### Assistant Modes

1. **Exploration Mode** (Default):
   - Open-ended conversation about the document
   - Focused on gathering information naturally

2. **Targeted Completion Mode**:
   - Activated when specific fields need attention
   - More directed questions to complete required information

3. **Refinement Mode**:
   - Reviewing existing content for improvements
   - Suggesting enhancements and alternatives

### Conversation Flows

#### Initial Conversation
```
AI: "Let's create a new project. What's this project about?"

User: "It's a machine learning model that predicts customer churn based on usage patterns."

AI: "That sounds interesting! When did you work on this project, and what was the main goal?"

User: "We built it last quarter to help reduce customer loss by identifying at-risk accounts before they cancel."

AI: [Extracts and fills multiple fields]:
- Title: "Customer Churn Prediction Model"
- Category: "Machine Learning"
- Timeline: Q3 2023
- Problem: "Identifying at-risk customer accounts before they cancel"
```

#### Iterative Improvement
```
AI: "I've added those details. The problem statement is clear, but we still need to describe the solution approach. How did you address this challenge?"

User: "We collected historical usage data, created feature vectors from engagement metrics, and trained a gradient boosting model."

AI: "Great, I've updated the solution section. Would you like me to expand on the technical approach with more details about the gradient boosting model?"

User: "Yes, please highlight that we used XGBoost and achieved 87% accuracy."

AI: [Updates solution with technical details and adds metrics to results section]
```

#### Content Enhancement
```
AI: "I notice your project description is quite technical. Would you like me to create a more accessible version for non-technical readers while preserving the original for the technical details section?"

User: "Yes, that would be helpful."

AI: [Creates two versions of the description - technical and general audience]
```

## Visual Experience

- **Live Updates**: Show content changes in real-time as AI updates fields
- **Field Highlighting**: Visually indicate fields being discussed
- **Progress Indicators**: Display completion status of required vs. optional fields
- **Suggestion Preview**: Allow user to view and edit AI suggestions before applying

## Metrics for Success

1. **Completion Rate**: % of documents completed with assistant vs. without
2. **Time Savings**: Average time to create complete documents
3. **Field Coverage**: % of available fields that get populated
4. **User Satisfaction**: Feedback on helpfulness of suggestions
5. **Iteration Reduction**: Fewer edits needed after initial content creation

## Technical Constraints & Considerations

- Ensure proper handling of structured content (arrays, references, etc.)
- Maintain appropriate permission boundaries
- Respect character limits and field validation rules
- Implement proper versioning for content changes
- Consider performance implications of multiple field updates

## Out of Scope for MVP

- Research integration with external sources
- Multi-document awareness and cross-referencing
- Advanced SEO optimization
- Image generation or visual asset creation
- Integration with external workflows
