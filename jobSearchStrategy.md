# Will Diamond's AI Engineering Job Search Strategy

## Job Target Focus
- **Role Focus**: Software/AI Engineering with emphasis on innovative LLM applications
- **Company Profile**: Mid-stage startups and growth companies building cutting-edge LLM products
- **Tech Stack Alignment**: Companies using technologies I've worked with (NextJS, React, Python, LLM infrastructure)
- **Ideal Environment**: Collaborative teams building AI applications that solve meaningful problems
- **Non-Targets**: Very early-stage startups (pre-product) and large tech incumbents

## Three-Tier Application Strategy
1. **Backup Tier**: Companies I'm interested in but not passionate about
   - Use for interview practice and confidence building
   - Apply early in the process to build momentum
   - Approach with genuine interest but lower pressure
   - Potentially accept if the role and compensation are good

2. **Target Tier**: Companies I'm genuinely excited about
   - Apply after gaining some confidence from initial interviews
   - Leverage network connections when possible
   - Prepare more thoroughly for these opportunities
   - These represent my "ideal fit" positions

3. **Reach Tier**: Companies or roles above my current level
   - Positions that stretch my current skills and experience
   - Apply to gain exposure to higher-level interview processes
   - Use as learning opportunities even if rejection is likely
   - Occasionally results in surprising opportunities

## Finding Companies (Pain Point Strategy)

### Product-First Company Discovery
- Start with products/tools I admire and would want to work on
- Identify companies building interesting AI developer tools, productivity tools, or vertical LLM applications
- Look at companies with similar missions to my current work (legal tech, information access)

### Efficient Company Research Methods
- **YCombinator's Recent Batches**: Filter for AI/ML startups
- **VC Portfolio Companies**: Check Sequoia, a16z, and other VC firms' AI investments
- **ProductHunt**: Browse recent LLM-based product launches
- **Twitter/LinkedIn**: Follow hashtags like #llmstartups, #aistartups
- **AI Indices & Newsletters**: Subscribe to AI-focused newsletters that feature emerging companies
- **Built With Methodology**: Find companies using tech stacks I'm familiar with

### Company List Building Process
1. Create a "Companies of Interest" spreadsheet
2. Set target of identifying 15 new companies weekly
3. Categorize as "Backup Tier," "Target Tier," or "Reach Tier"
4. Limit research to 5-10 minutes per company initially
5. Deeper research only for companies moving to application stage

## Application Management (Pain Point Strategy)

### Application Tracking System
- Simple spreadsheet with columns:
  - Company name
  - Role/position
  - Application date
  - Application status (Not Started, Applied, Interview Scheduled, etc.)
  - Follow-up date
  - Source/Contact
  - Notes

### Weekly Workflow Components
- **Company Research**: Dedicated sessions to find new companies
- **Application Preparation**: Resume customization, cover letter writing
- **Application Submission**: Focused time blocks for submitting applications
- **Technical Practice**: Interview preparation, coding challenges
- **Networking**: Leveraging Sunday Hustle community and other connections
- **Follow-ups**: Regular check-ins on submitted applications

### First Batch Strategy
- Focus initial applications on "Backup" and "Reach" tier companies
- Use these interviews to build interview skills and confidence
- Apply to 3-4 companies from each tier for the first batch
- Run these interview processes in parallel with continued preparation
- Document learnings from each interview to improve for "Target" tier applications

### Momentum Maintenance Strategies
- Weekly application goals (5-8 quality applications)
