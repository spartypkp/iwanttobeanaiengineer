## Page Goal

Get qualified companies to book a discovery call. Keep it simple, honest, concise.

---

## Page Structure

### 1. Hero

**Headline:** Applied AI Engineering

**Subheadline:** I build AI systems for small companies in regulated industries. Strategy to deployment, no handoffs.

**CTA:** "Schedule a Call"

---

### 2. What I Do

**Heading:** What I Build

I help companies integrate AI into their workflows. This means understanding your business, finding opportunities, building working systems, and ensuring compliance. I handle both the strategy and the code.

**Industries:** Legal • Compliance • Professional Services • Finance • Healthcare

---

### 3. Services

**Heading:** How I Work

**Assessment**
$8k - $12k • 3-4 weeks

Interview your team, understand workflows, identify AI opportunities with ROI projections. You get a clear roadmap.

*Deliverable: Assessment report + presentation*

---

**Implementation**
$10k - $15k • 4-6 weeks

Build 1-2 working automations. Train your team, ensure compliance, document everything.

*Deliverable: Working tools + documentation + trained team*

---

**Ongoing Partnership**
$15k - $25k/month • 3-6 months

Act as your part-time technical lead. Build custom AI applications, optimize systems, provide strategic guidance.

*Deliverable: Production systems + sustainable capability*

---

### 4. Approach

**Heading:** How I Work

I interview your team at all levels - executives, managers, individual contributors. I watch the actual work happen. I find the gaps between what people say and what they do. That's where the opportunities are.

**Example:**
At Contoural, two consultants were doing the same task completely differently. That discrepancy revealed the opportunity. The system I built reduced analysis time by 75%.

---

### 5. Previous Work

**Contoural (Legal Tech Startup)**
2 years building AI systems for legal research and compliance
- 75% reduction in analysis time
- $300k+ annual savings
- 99.9% uptime in production

**Other Projects**
- Built multi-agent poker system (Texas Hold LLM) demonstrating complex AI coordination
- Designed AI strategy for Roman AI (A16Z-backed)
- Contract rate: $20k/month achieved

---

### 6. Why Contract vs Full-Time

No benefits costs, no onboarding time, no management overhead. You get someone who's done this before and can start immediately.

**Example:** A $10k assessment that saves 2 hours/week across 5 people = 520 hours/year = $26k annual savings at $50/hour employee cost. ROI in 5 months.

---

### 7. About

I'm an AI engineer based in San Francisco. I spent 2 years building AI systems for Contoural (legal tech startup), where I learned both the technical side and the compliance side of working in regulated industries.

I work with small companies (10-100 people) that need both strategy and implementation but don't have a technical team.

**Tech:** Python, TypeScript, React, LLMs, PostgreSQL

### 8. FAQ

**Q: What if we're not technical?**
A: That's fine. I translate between business needs and technical implementation.

A: Start with an assessment. Low risk, identifies real opportunities before committing to build anything.

**Q: What about compliance and data privacy?**
A: 2 years experience building AI in legal tech. I know regulated industries.
